# Multivariate-Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Air-Quality-using-LSTM


This project focuses on developing a multivariate time series forecasting model to predict air quality in a specific region using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach. The dataset consists of various environmental parameters and air pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological variables. The main objective of this project is to predict the Air Temperature (AT) one hour ahead based on the previous five hours of historical data. The workflow includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the data, preprocessing steps including splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and building a baseline LSTM model with a simple hidden layer. Furthermore, architectural and hyperparameter tuning is conducted to improve model performance, which is then evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score. The outcome of this project is expected to provide insights into how deep learning, particularly LSTM, can be effectively applied to solve multivariate time series forecasting problems for air quality prediction.
